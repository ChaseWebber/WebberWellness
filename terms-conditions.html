        <h1>Get-Real Wellness Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <p class="policy-updated">Last updated: April 01, 2025</p>
        <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Get-Real Wellness app (hereby referred to as “Application”) for mobile devices that was created by CHASE WEBBER (hereby referred to as “Service Provider”) as a Subscription service.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.</p>

        <h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All trademarks remain the property of the Service Provider.</li>
            <li>All copyrights and database rights remain the property of the Service Provider.</li>
            <li>All other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Updates and Charges</h2>
        <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Premium Subscription</h2>
        <p>Get-Real Wellness offers the Premium Subscription that grants you access to additional features. You can purchase and/or subscribe to Premium as an in-app purchase. By paying the subscription fee you get access to Premium features during the time your subscription is valid, subject to these Terms and Conditions. All subscriptions with Premium are paid in advance. You may at any time terminate your membership, in which case your membership will still be valid for the subscription time you have already paid for. You hereby consent to start using the Services immediately upon subscribing with Get-Real Wellness Premium or other paid products. On the first Subscription you will have 7 days Free Trial to withdraw from the contract with Get-Real Wellness from the date you receive confirmation of your subscription. Get-Real Wellness reserves the right to change the subscription fees from time to time.</p>
        <p>Users purchase subscriptions for Get-Real Wellness App through the App Store are governed by the terms and conditions of the App Store. Please contact the App Store in connection with any issues regarding payments, renewals and refunds.</p>
        <p>If you have subscribed to Get-Real Wellness Premium through the use of App Store using in-app purchase, you can only cancel your subscription through the use of their services. Apple subscription purchases are handled by Apple Inc. Get-Real Wellness does not have access to your billing information and cannot issue a refund. To request refund and with other issues regarding subscription please contact Apple Inc.</p>
        <p>You can at any time choose to cancel/end your account by contacting the Service Provider. Please note that uninstalling the mobile application or closing your account will not automatically stop your Premium subscription — you must actively cancel the subscription. The subscription will automatically renew monthly unless turned off in your App Store Account Settings at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You can go to your App Store Account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all. Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Internet Connection</h2>
        <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
        <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider’s agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.

In terms of the Service Provider’s responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Updates</h2>
        <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application.


The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.


The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>

        <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-04-01</p>
